INSTRUCTIONS

You are in a mine field where mines are triggered very easily...
- avoid the mines or destroy the mines with anti-mine charges $
- mines are triggered behind you and also slowly next to you
- collect anti-mine charges $ (+10 points)
- one step (+1 point)
- reach 500 points for extra life and full recharge of charges
- charges are scarce and you can only carry at most 9

So it is mostly a strategy game:
- Search for a possibly free path to anti-mines charges
- Create new paths to safer areas
- Do NOT move too fast because mines are triggered next to you
